# Rules & Guidelines
The following are the rules and guidelines for sharing workshop content with the Avrae Community. 
You do NOT need to publish your collection publicly in order to use or share any of it within your own campaign. 
Any content that violates these rules and guidelines will be removed, and the creator(s) may be subject to restrictions.

## Unacceptable content for Public Content
### Server Specific Creations
Workshop content should be available for anyone to use, regardless of what server they're on. Code written specifically for one Discord server should not be published to the workshop; consider using an unlisted collection instead. Published collections that are written for one specific server or that include an invite link to the server it is meant for may be removed.

### Naming and Shaming
We don't want to see one sided accusations or any other form of naming and shaming as part of any content.

### Personal Information
Personal information about yourself or anyone else should also not be posted in any workshop content.

### Spamming and Trolling
Neither spamming nor trolling is acceptable as part of any Alias Workshop creation. This includes but isnâ€™t limited to: 
creating content for the sole purpose of causing unrest, excessively communicating the same phrase, similar phrases, 
or pure gibberish, posting meme or troll text as part of alias content.

## Included content that will result in a ban
- Illegal PDF/ download of official content or the websites that create/use them.
- Keyloggers, hoaxes, and/or phishing websites.
- Activities considered illegal by Wizards of the Coast.
- Religious opinions/debates (from the real world - fantasy religious principles are generally okay if they are not inflammatory).
- Hateful language about race, religion, country (Example: US vs. EU threads), political beliefs, etc.
- Sexually explicit content
- Content that is considered illegal by law.
- Referral links for contests, promotions, or anything else.
- Advertisements for other services

## For official D&D Content
If your creation (alias/snippet) uses mechanics, wording, or other content from non-free D&D content, that creation
must be tagged with the appropriate license (available in the creation's edit menu). Creations that do not have 
the appropriate licenses added may be removed, or the licences may be added by a moderator.
